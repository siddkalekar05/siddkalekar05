## 🛠️ Project

### **ClubConnect – College Club Management System**

**ClubConnect** is a Java-based desktop application designed to **digitize and streamline college club management**.  
The system replaces manual coordination with a **centralized, role-based platform** that improves task tracking, communication, and accountability among club members.

The application is built using **JavaFX** for the user interface and **Firebase Authentication & Realtime Database** for backend services, following the **MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

### 🔐 Key Features
- Secure user authentication using Firebase Authentication  
- Role-based access control (Admin / Club Lead / Member)  
- Separate dashboards for different user roles  
- Task management system:
  - Create, assign, view, and submit tasks  
- Real-time data synchronization using Firebase Realtime Database  
- Clean and responsive JavaFX UI with reusable components  

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **UI:** JavaFX  
- **Backend:** Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database  
- **Architecture:** MVC  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Maven  

### 🎯 Project Outcome
ClubConnect provides an **efficient and scalable solution** for managing college clubs and activities.  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in **Java application development, authentication flows, backend integration, and real-world software architecture**.
